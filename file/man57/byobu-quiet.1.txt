NNAAMMEE
       byobu-quiet  -  Silence  all of Byobu's status indicators and eliminate
       the hardstatus line

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       bbyyoobbuu--qquuiieett will disable ALL of Byobu's status indicators and eliminate
       the hardstatus line.

       Some  administrators,  in some environments, at some times may prefer a
       very minimal, quiet Byobu, without the potentially  distracting  status
       indicators  and  eye  candy.  However, the window menu is preserved, as
       well as all of Byobu's keybindings and helper utilities.   To  elminate
       the window list, use bbyyoobbuu--ssiilleenntt(1).
