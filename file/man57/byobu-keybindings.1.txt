       bbyyoobbuu--kkeeyybbiinnddiinnggss toggles on and off Byobu's keybindings in the current
       ttmmuuxx(1) or ssccrreeeenn(1) session.  It will only operate against the current
       session.

       This  executable is provided as an alternative to pressing <Shift>-F12,
       and is useful in environments where <Shift>-F12 does not work (e.g., on
       the Linux console TTY).

       Some  Byobu  users  toggle  these  keybindings when they interfere with
       other programs using the same keybindings (e.g., mmcc(1)).
