       aappppoorrtt--bbuugg reports problems to your distribution's bug tracking system,
       using Apport to collect a lot of local information about your system to
       help the developers to fix the  problem  and  avoid  unnecessary  ques-
       tion/answer turnarounds.

       You  should  always  start  with  running aappppoorrtt--bbuugg without arguments,
       which will present a list of known symptoms.  This  will  generate  the
       most useful bug reports.

       If  there  is  no  matching symptom, you need to determine the affected
       program or package yourself. You can provide a package name or  program
       name to aappppoorrtt--bbuugg, e. g.:

           apport-bug firefox
           apport-bug /usr/bin/unzip

       In  order to add more information to the bug report that could help the
       developers to fix the problem,  you  can  also  specify  a  process  ID
       instead:

           $ pidof gnome-terminal
           5139
           $ apport-bug 5139

       As a special case, to report a bug against the Linux kernel, you do not
       need   to   use   the   full   package    name    (such    as    linux-
       image-2.6.28-4-generic); you can just use

           apport-bug linux

       to report a bug against the currently running kernel.

       Finally,  you  can use this program to report a previously stored crash
       or bug report:

           apport-bug /var/crash/_bin_bash.1000.crash
           apport-bug /tmp/apport.firefox.332G9t.apport

       Bug reports can be written to a file by using the ----ssaavvee option  or  by
       using aappppoorrtt--ccllii.

       aappppoorrtt--bbuugg detects whether KDE or Gnome is running and calls aappppoorrtt--ggttkk
       or aappppoorrtt--kkddee accordingly. If neither is available, or the session does
       not run under X11, it calls aappppoorrtt--ccllii for a command-line client.

       aappppoorrtt--ccoolllleecctt collects the same information as apport-bug, but adds it
       to an already reported problem you have submitted. This  is  useful  if
       the  report was not originally filed through Apport, and the developers
       ask you to attach information from your system.

              Apport refuses to create bug  reports  if  the  package  or  any
              dependency  is not current. If this environment variable is set,
              this check is waived. Experts who will thoroughly check the sit-
              uation  before  filing  a  bug  report  can define this in their
              ~~//..bbaasshhrrcc or  temporarily  on  the  command  line  when  calling
              aappppoorrtt--bbuugg.


FFIILLEESS
       apport  crash  files  are  written  in  to //vvaarr//ccrraasshh by default, named
       uniquely per binary name and user id.  They are not deleted after being
       sent  to  the  bug  tracker  (but  from cron when they get older than 7
       days). You can extract the core file (if  any)  and  other  information
       using aappppoorrtt--uunnppaacckk..
