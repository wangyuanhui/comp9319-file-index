       aappppoorrtt  automatically collects data from crashed processes and compiles
       a problem report in _/_v_a_r_/_c_r_a_s_h_/. This is a command  line  frontend  for
       reporting  those  crashes  to  the  developers.  It can also be used to
       report bugs about packages or running processes.

       If symptom scripts are available, it can also be given the  name  of  a
       symptom, or be called with just --ff to display a list of known symptoms.

       When  being  called without any options, it processes the pending crash
       reports and offers to report them one by one. You can also display  the
       entire report to see what is sent to the software developers.

       When  being  called with exactly one argument and no option, aappppoorrtt--ccllii
       uses some heuristics to find out "what you  mean"  and  reports  a  bug
       against  the given symptom name, package name, program path, or PID. If
       the argument is a ..ccrraasshh or ..aappppoorrtt file, it uploads the stored problem
       report to the bug tracking system.

       For  desktop  systems  with a graphical user interface, you should con-
       sider installing the GTK or KDE user interface (apport-gtk  or  apport-
       kde).  They  accept the very same options and arguments.  aappppoorrtt--ccllii is
       mainly intended to be used on servers.


OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --ff,, ----ffiillee--bbuugg
              Report a (non-crash) problem. If neither  ----ppaacckkaaggee,  ----ssyymmppttoomm,
              or  ----ppiidd  are  specified,  then it displays a list of available
              symptoms. If none are available, it aborts with an error.

              This will automatically attach information about your  operating
              system  and  the package version etc. to the bug report, so that
              the developers have some important context.


       --ss _s_y_m_p_t_o_m, ----ssyymmppttoomm=_s_y_m_p_t_o_m
              When being used in  ----ffiillee--bbuugg  mode,  specify  the  symptom  to
              report the problem about.


       --pp _p_a_c_k_a_g_e, ----ppaacckkaaggee=_p_a_c_k_a_g_e
              When  being  used  in  ----ffiillee--bbuugg  mode,  specify the package to
              report the problem against.


       --PP _p_i_d, ----ppiidd=_p_i_d
              When being used in ----ffiillee--bbuugg mode, specify the PID (process ID)
              of  a running program to report the problem against. This can be
              determined with e. g.  ppss --uuxx.


       --cc _r_e_p_o_r_t, ----ccrraasshh--ffiillee=_r_e_p_o_r_t
              Upload a previously processed stored report in an arbitrary file
              location.   This  is  useful  for  copying  a  crash report to a
              machine with internet connection and reporting  it  from  there.
              Files must end in ..ccrraasshh or ..aappppoorrtt.


       --uu _r_e_p_o_r_t_-_n_u_m_b_e_r, ----uuppddaattee--rreeppoorrtt _r_e_p_o_r_t_-_n_u_m_b_e_r
              Run apport information collection on an already existing problem
              report. The  affected  package  is  taken  from  the  report  by
              default,  but  you  can explicitly specify one with --package to
              collect information for a different package (this is  useful  if
              the report is assigned to the wrong package).


       ----ssaavvee _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              In  --file-bug  mode, save the collected information into a file
              instead of reporting it. This file can  then  be  reported  with
              --crash-file later on.


       --ww,, ----wwiinnddooww
              Point and click at the application window against which you wish
              to report the bug. Apport will automatically  find  the  package
              name and generate a report for you. This option can be specially
              useful in situations when you do not know the name of the  pack-
              age, or if the application window has stopped responding and you
              cannot report the problem from the "Help" menu of  the  applica-
              tion.

              Apport  refuses  to  create  bug  reports  if the package or any
              dependency is not current. If this environment variable is  set,
              this check is waived. Experts who will thoroughly check the sit-
              uation before filing a bug  report  can  define  this  in  their
              ~~//..bbaasshhrrcc or temporarily when calling the apport frontend (-cli,
              -gtk, or -kde).

              Symptom scripts. These ask a set  of  interactive  questions  to
              determine  the  package  which  is  responsible for a particular
              problem. (For some problems like sound or storage device related
              bugs  there  are many places where things can go wrong, and it's
              not immediately obvious for a bug  reporter  where  the  problem
              is.)
