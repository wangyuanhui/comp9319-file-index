       byobu-ctrl-a - Configure Byobu's ctrl-a behavior


DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       bbyyoobbuu--ccttrrll--aa  is an interactive program that allows a user to configure
       the behavior of the 'ctrl-a' key sequence.

       Traditional GNU ssccrreeeenn(1) uses ctrl-a as its  escape  character,  while
       GNU  eemmaaccss(1)  uses  ctrl-a  to move the cursor to the beginning of the
       line.  This conflict has caused unending amounts of grief among Screen,
       Byobu, and Emacs-mode users.

       Thus,  this program exists to allow each user to choose the behavior of
       ctrl-a in their local environment.
