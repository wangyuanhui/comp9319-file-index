DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       aapptt--ffttppaarrcchhiivvee is the command line tool that generates the index files
       that APT uses to access a distribution source. The index files should
       be generated on the origin site based on the content of that site.

       aapptt--ffttppaarrcchhiivvee is a superset of the ddppkkgg--ssccaannppaacckkaaggeess(1) program,
       incorporating its entire functionality via the packages command. It
       also contains a contents file generator, contents, and an elaborate
       means to 'script' the generation process for a complete archive.

       Internally aapptt--ffttppaarrcchhiivvee can make use of binary databases to cache the
       contents of a .deb file and it does not rely on any external programs
       aside from ggzziipp(1). When doing a full generate it automatically
       performs file-change checks and builds the desired compressed output
       files.

       Unless the --hh, or ----hheellpp option is given, one of the commands below
       must be present.

       ppaacckkaaggeess
           The packages command generates a package file from a directory
           tree. It takes the given directory and recursively searches it for
           .deb files, emitting a package record to stdout for each. This
           command is approximately equivalent to ddppkkgg--ssccaannppaacckkaaggeess(1).

           The option ----ddbb can be used to specify a binary caching DB.

       ssoouurrcceess
           The sources command generates a source index file from a directory
           tree. It takes the given directory and recursively searches it for
           .dsc files, emitting a source record to stdout for each. This
           command is approximately equivalent to ddppkkgg--ssccaannssoouurrcceess(1).

           If an override file is specified then a source override file will
           be looked for with an extension of .src. The --source-override
           option can be used to change the source override file that will be
           used.

       ccoonntteennttss
           The contents command generates a contents file from a directory
           tree. It takes the given directory and recursively searches it for
           .deb files, and reads the file list from each file. It then sorts
           and writes to stdout the list of files matched to packages.
           Directories are not written to the output. If multiple packages own
           the same file then each package is separated by a comma in the
           output.

           The option ----ddbb can be used to specify a binary caching DB.

       rreelleeaassee
           The release command generates a Release file from a directory tree.
           It recursively searches the given directory for uncompressed
           Packages and Sources files and ones compressed with ggzziipp, bbzziipp22 or
           llzzmmaa as well as Release and md5sum.txt files by default
           (APT::FTPArchive::Release::Default-Patterns). Additional filename
           patterns can be added by listing them in
           APT::FTPArchive::Release::Patterns. It then writes to stdout a
           Release file containing an MD5, SHA1 and SHA256 digest for each
           file.

           Values for the additional metadata fields in the Release file are
           taken from the corresponding variables under
           APT::FTPArchive::Release, e.g.  APT::FTPArchive::Release::Origin.
           The supported fields are: Origin, Label, Suite, Version, Codename,
           Date, Valid-Until, Architectures, Components, Description.

       ggeenneerraattee
           The generate command is designed to be runnable from a cron script
           and builds indexes according to the given config file. The config
           language provides a flexible means of specifying which index files
           are built from which directories, as well as providing a simple
           means of maintaining the required settings.

       cclleeaann
           The clean command tidies the databases used by the given
           configuration file by removing any records that are no longer
           necessary.

TTHHEE GGEENNEERRAATTEE CCOONNFFIIGGUURRAATTIIOONN
       The generate command uses a configuration file to describe the archives
       that are going to be generated. It follows the typical ISC
       configuration format as seen in ISC tools like bind 8 and dhcpd.
       aapptt..ccoonnff(5) contains a description of the syntax. Note that the
       generate configuration is parsed in sectional manner, but aapptt..ccoonnff(5)
       is parsed in a tree manner. This only effects how the scope tag is
       handled.

       The generate configuration has four separate sections, each described
       below.

   DDiirr SSeeccttiioonn
       The Dir section defines the standard directories needed to locate the
       files required during the generation process. These directories are
       prepended certain relative paths defined in later sections to produce a
       complete an absolute path.

       AArrcchhiivveeDDiirr
           Specifies the root of the FTP archive, in a standard Debian
           configuration this is the directory that contains the ls-LR and
           dist nodes.

       OOvveerrrriiddeeDDiirr
           Specifies the location of the override files.

       CCaacchheeDDiirr
           Specifies the location of the cache files.

       FFiilleeLLiissttDDiirr
           Specifies the location of the file list files, if the FileList
           setting is used below.

   DDeeffaauulltt SSeeccttiioonn
       The Default section specifies default values, and settings that control
       the operation of the generator. Other sections may override these
       defaults with a per-section setting.

       PPaacckkaaggeess::::CCoommpprreessss
           Sets the default compression schemes to use for the package index
           files. It is a string that contains a space separated list of at
           least one of: '.' (no compression), 'gzip' and 'bzip2'. The default
           for all compression schemes is '. gzip'.

       PPaacckkaaggeess::::EExxtteennssiioonnss
           Sets the default list of file extensions that are package files.
           This defaults to '.deb'.

       SSoouurrcceess::::CCoommpprreessss
           This is similar to Packages::Compress except that it controls the
           compression for the Sources files.

       SSoouurrcceess::::EExxtteennssiioonnss
           Sets the default list of file extensions that are source files.
           This defaults to '.dsc'.

       CCoonntteennttss::::CCoommpprreessss
           This is similar to Packages::Compress except that it controls the
           compression for the Contents files.

       TTrraannssllaattiioonn::::CCoommpprreessss
           This is similar to Packages::Compress except that it controls the
           compression for the Translation-en master file.

       DDeeLLiinnkkLLiimmiitt
           Specifies the number of kilobytes to delink (and replace with hard
           links) per run. This is used in conjunction with the per-section
           External-Links setting.

       FFiilleeMMooddee
           Specifies the mode of all created index files. It defaults to 0644.
           All index files are set to this mode with no regard to the umask.

       LLoonnggDDeessccrriippttiioonn
           Specifies whether long descriptions should be included in the
           Packages file or split out into a master Translation-en file.

   TTrreeeeDDeeffaauulltt SSeeccttiioonn
       Sets defaults specific to Tree sections. All of these variables are
       substitution variables and have the strings $(DIST), $(SECTION) and
       $(ARCH) replaced with their respective values.

       MMaaxxCCoonntteennttssCChhaannggee
           Sets the number of kilobytes of contents files that are generated
           each day. The contents files are round-robined so that over several
           days they will all be rebuilt.

       CCoonntteennttssAAggee
           Controls the number of days a contents file is allowed to be
           checked without changing. If this limit is passed the mtime of the
           contents file is updated. This case can occur if the package file
           is changed in such a way that does not result in a new contents
           file [override edit for instance]. A hold off is allowed in hopes
           that new .debs will be installed, requiring a new file anyhow. The
           default is 10, the units are in days.

       DDiirreeccttoorryy
           Sets the top of the .deb directory tree. Defaults to
           $(DIST)/$(SECTION)/binary-$(ARCH)/

       SSrrccDDiirreeccttoorryy
           Sets the top of the source package directory tree. Defaults to
           $(DIST)/$(SECTION)/source/

       PPaacckkaaggeess
           Sets the output Packages file. Defaults to
           $(DIST)/$(SECTION)/binary-$(ARCH)/Packages

       SSoouurrcceess
           Sets the output Sources file. Defaults to
           $(DIST)/$(SECTION)/source/Sources

       TTrraannssllaattiioonn
           Sets the output Translation-en master file with the long
           descriptions if they should be not included in the Packages file.
           Defaults to $(DIST)/$(SECTION)/i18n/Translation-en

       IInntteerrnnaallPPrreeffiixx
           Sets the path prefix that causes a symlink to be considered an
           internal link instead of an external link. Defaults to
           $(DIST)/$(SECTION)/

       CCoonntteennttss
           Sets the output Contents file. Defaults to
           $(DIST)/$(SECTION)/Contents-$(ARCH). If this setting causes
           multiple Packages files to map onto a single Contents file (as is
           the default) then aapptt--ffttppaarrcchhiivvee will integrate those package files
           together automatically.

       CCoonntteennttss::::HHeeaaddeerr
           Sets header file to prepend to the contents output.

       BBiinnCCaacchheeDDBB
           Sets the binary cache database to use for this section. Multiple
           sections can share the same database.

       FFiilleeLLiisstt
           Specifies that instead of walking the directory tree,
           aapptt--ffttppaarrcchhiivvee should read the list of files from the given file.
           Relative files names are prefixed with the archive directory.

       SSoouurrcceeFFiilleeLLiisstt
           Specifies that instead of walking the directory tree,
           aapptt--ffttppaarrcchhiivvee should read the list of files from the given file.
           Relative files names are prefixed with the archive directory. This
           is used when processing source indexes.

   TTrreeee SSeeccttiioonn
       The Tree section defines a standard Debian file tree which consists of
       a base directory, then multiple sections in that base directory and
       finally multiple Architectures in each section. The exact pathing used
       is defined by the Directory substitution variable.

       The Tree section takes a scope tag which sets the $(DIST) variable and
       defines the root of the tree (the path is prefixed by ArchiveDir).
       Typically this is a setting such as dists/wheezy.

       All of the settings defined in the TreeDefault section can be used in a
       Tree section as well as three new variables.

       When processing a Tree section aapptt--ffttppaarrcchhiivvee performs an operation
       similar to:

           for i in Sections do
              for j in Architectures do
                 Generate for DIST=scope SECTION=i ARCH=j



       SSeeccttiioonnss
           This is a space separated list of sections which appear under the
           distribution; typically this is something like main contrib
           non-free

       AArrcchhiitteeccttuurreess
           This is a space separated list of all the architectures that appear
           under search section. The special architecture 'source' is used to
           indicate that this tree has a source archive.

       LLoonnggDDeessccrriippttiioonn
           Specifies whether long descriptions should be included in the
           Packages file or split out into a master Translation-en file.

       BBiinnOOvveerrrriiddee
           Sets the binary override file. The override file contains section,
           priority and maintainer address information.

       SSrrccOOvveerrrriiddee
           Sets the source override file. The override file contains section
           information.

       EExxttrraaOOvveerrrriiddee
           Sets the binary extra override file.

       SSrrccEExxttrraaOOvveerrrriiddee
           Sets the source extra override file.

   BBiinnDDiirreeccttoorryy SSeeccttiioonn
       The bindirectory section defines a binary directory tree with no
       special structure. The scope tag specifies the location of the binary
       directory and the settings are similar to the Tree section with no
       substitution variables or SectionArchitecture settings.

       PPaacckkaaggeess
           Sets the Packages file output.

       SSoouurrcceess
           Sets the Sources file output. At least one of Packages or Sources
           is required.

       CCoonntteennttss
           Sets the Contents file output (optional).

       BBiinnOOvveerrrriiddee
           Sets the binary override file.

       SSrrccOOvveerrrriiddee
           Sets the source override file.

       EExxttrraaOOvveerrrriiddee
           Sets the binary extra override file.

       SSrrccEExxttrraaOOvveerrrriiddee
           Sets the source extra override file.

       BBiinnCCaacchheeDDBB
           Sets the cache DB.

       PPaatthhPPrreeffiixx
           Appends a path to all the output paths.

       FFiilleeLLiisstt, SSoouurrcceeFFiilleeLLiisstt
           Specifies the file list file.

TTHHEE BBIINNAARRYY OOVVEERRRRIIDDEE FFIILLEE
       The binary override file is fully compatible with ddppkkgg--ssccaannppaacckkaaggeess(1).
       It contains four fields separated by spaces. The first field is the
       package name, the second is the priority to force that package to, the
       third is the section to force that package to and the final field is
       the maintainer permutation field.

       The general form of the maintainer field is:

           old [// oldn]* => new

       or simply,

           new

       The first form allows a double-slash separated list of old email
       addresses to be specified. If any of those are found then new is
       substituted for the maintainer field. The second form unconditionally
       substitutes the maintainer field.

TTHHEE SSOOUURRCCEE OOVVEERRRRIIDDEE FFIILLEE
       The source override file is fully compatible with ddppkkgg--ssccaannssoouurrcceess(1).
       It contains two fields separated by spaces. The first field is the
       source package name, the second is the section to assign it.

TTHHEE EEXXTTRRAA OOVVEERRRRIIDDEE FFIILLEE
       The extra override file allows any arbitrary tag to be added or
       replaced in the output. It has three columns, the first is the package,
       the second is the tag and the remainder of the line is the new value.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       All command line options may be set using the configuration file, the
       descriptions indicate the configuration option to set. For boolean
       options you can override the config file by using something like
       --ff--,----nnoo--ff, --ff==nnoo or several other variations.

       ----mmdd55, ----sshhaa11, ----sshhaa225566
           Generate the given checksum. These options default to on, when
           turned off the generated index files will not have the checksum
           fields where possible. Configuration Items:
           APT::FTPArchive::_C_h_e_c_k_s_u_m and APT::FTPArchive::_I_n_d_e_x::_C_h_e_c_k_s_u_m
           where _I_n_d_e_x can be Packages, Sources or Release and _C_h_e_c_k_s_u_m can be
           MD5, SHA1 or SHA256.

       --dd, ----ddbb
           Use a binary caching DB. This has no effect on the generate
           command. Configuration Item: APT::FTPArchive::DB.

       --qq, ----qquuiieett
           Quiet; produces output suitable for logging, omitting progress
           indicators. More q's will produce more quiet up to a maximum of 2.
           You can also use --qq==## to set the quiet level, overriding the
           configuration file. Configuration Item: quiet.

       ----ddeelliinnkk
           Perform Delinking. If the External-Links setting is used then this
           option actually enables delinking of the files. It defaults to on
           and can be turned off with ----nnoo--ddeelliinnkk. Configuration Item:
           APT::FTPArchive::DeLinkAct.

       ----ccoonntteennttss
           Perform contents generation. When this option is set and package
           indexes are being generated with a cache DB then the file listing
           will also be extracted and stored in the DB for later use. When
           using the generate command this option also allows the creation of
           any Contents files. The default is on. Configuration Item:
           APT::FTPArchive::Contents.

       --ss, ----ssoouurrccee--oovveerrrriiddee
           Select the source override file to use with the sources command.
           Configuration Item: APT::FTPArchive::SourceOverride.

       ----rreeaaddoonnllyy
           Make the caching databases read only. Configuration Item:
           APT::FTPArchive::ReadOnlyDB.

       --aa, ----aarrcchh
           Accept in the packages and contents commands only package files
           matching *_arch.deb or *_all.deb instead of all package files in
           the given path. Configuration Item: APT::FTPArchive::Architecture.

       AAPPTT::::FFTTPPAArrcchhiivvee::::AAllwwaayyssSSttaatt
           aapptt--ffttppaarrcchhiivvee(1) caches as much as possible of metadata in a
           cachedb. If packages are recompiled and/or republished with the
           same version again, this will lead to problems as the now outdated
           cached metadata like size and checksums will be used. With this
           option enabled this will no longer happen as it will be checked if
           the file was changed. Note that this option is set to "false" by
           default as it is not recommend to upload multiply versions/builds
           of a package with the same versionnumber, so in theory nobody will
           have these problems and therefore all these extra checks are
           useless.

       AAPPTT::::FFTTPPAArrcchhiivvee::::LLoonnggDDeessccrriippttiioonn
           This configuration option defaults to "true" and should only be set
           to "false" if the Archive generated with aapptt--ffttppaarrcchhiivvee(1) also
           provides Translation files. Note that the Translation-en master
           file can only be created in the generate command.

       --hh, ----hheellpp
           Show a short usage summary.

       --vv, ----vveerrssiioonn
           Show the program version.

       --cc, ----ccoonnffiigg--ffiillee
           Configuration File; Specify a configuration file to use. The
           program will read the default configuration file and then this
           configuration file. If configuration settings need to be set before
           the default configuration files are parsed specify a file with the
           AAPPTT__CCOONNFFIIGG environment variable. See aapptt..ccoonnff(5) for syntax
           information.

       --oo, ----ooppttiioonn
           Set a Configuration Option; This will set an arbitrary
           configuration option. The syntax is --oo FFoooo::::BBaarr==bbaarr.  --oo and
           ----ooppttiioonn can be used multiple times to set different options.
