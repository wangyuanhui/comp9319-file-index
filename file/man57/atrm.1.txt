       aatt and bbaattcchh read commands from standard  input  or  a  specified  file
       which are to be executed at a later time, using //bbiinn//sshh.

       aatt      executes commands at a specified time.

       aattqq     lists  the  user's  pending  jobs, unless the user is the supe-
               ruser; in that case, everybody's jobs are listed.   The  format
               of  the  output  lines (one for each job) is: Job number, date,
               hour, queue, and username.

       aattrrmm    deletes jobs, identified by their job number.

       bbaattcchh   executes commands when system  load  levels  permit;  in  other
               words,  when  the  load  average  drops below 1.5, or the value
               specified in the invocation of aattdd.

       AAtt allows fairly complex time  specifications,  extending  the  POSIX.2
       standard.   It  accepts  times of the form HHHH::MMMM to run a job at a spe-
       cific time of day.  (If that time is already  past,  the  next  day  is
       assumed.)   You  may  also specify mmiiddnniigghhtt,, nnoooonn,, or tteeaattiimmee (4pm) and
       you can have a time-of-day suffixed with AAMM or PPMM for  running  in  the
       morning or the evening.  You can also say what day the job will be run,
       by giving a date in the form mmoonntthh--nnaammee ddaayy with an optional  yyeeaarr,,  or
       giving  a  date  of  the form _M_M_D_D[_C_C]_Y_Y, _M_M/_D_D/[_C_C]_Y_Y, _D_D._M_M.[_C_C]_Y_Y or
       [_C_C]_Y_Y-_M_M-_D_D.  The specification of a date _m_u_s_t follow  the  specifica-
       tion  of  the  time  of  day.  You can also give times like nnooww ++ _c_o_u_n_t
       _t_i_m_e_-_u_n_i_t_s_, where the time-units can be mmiinnuutteess,, hhoouurrss,, ddaayyss,, or  wweeeekkss
       and  you  can  tell  aatt to run the job today by suffixing the time with
       ttooddaayy and to run the job tomorrow by suffixing the time with ttoommoorrrrooww..

       For example, to run a job at 4pm three days from now, you would  do  aatt
       44ppmm  ++ 33 ddaayyss,, to run a job at 10:00am on July 31, you would do aatt 1100aamm
       JJuull 3311 and to run a job at 1am tomorrow, you would do aatt 11aamm ttoommoorrrrooww..

       The  definition  of  the   time   specification   can   be   found   in
       _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_d_o_c_/_a_t_/_t_i_m_e_s_p_e_c.

       For  both  aatt  and  bbaattcchh, commands are read from standard input or the
       file specified with the --ff option and executed.  The working directory,
       the environment (except for the variables BBAASSHH__VVEERRSSIINNFFOO, DDIISSPPLLAAYY, EEUUIIDD,
       GGRROOUUPPSS, SSHHEELLLLOOPPTTSS, TTEERRMM, UUIIDD, and __) and the umask  are  retained  from
       the time of invocation.

       As  aatt  is currently implemented as a setuid program, other environment
       variables (e.g.  LLDD__LLIIBBRRAARRYY__PPAATTHH or LLDD__PPRREELLOOAADD) are also not  exported.
       This  may  change  in the future.  As a workaround, set these variables
       explicitly in your job.

       An aatt - or bbaattcchh - command invoked from a ssuu((11)) shell will  retain  the
       current  userid.   The  user will be mailed standard error and standard
       output from his commands, if any.  Mail will be sent using the  command
       //uussrr//ssbbiinn//sseennddmmaaiill.  If aatt is executed from a ssuu((11)) shell, the owner of
       the login shell will receive the mail.

       The superuser may use these commands in any  case.   For  other  users,
       permission  to  use  at  is  determined  by the files _/_e_t_c_/_a_t_._a_l_l_o_w and
       _/_e_t_c_/_a_t_._d_e_n_y.  See aatt..aallllooww(5) for details.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --VV      prints the version number to standard error and  exit  success-
               fully.

       --qq _q_u_e_u_e
               uses  the  specified  queue.  A queue designation consists of a
               single letter; valid queue designations range from aa to zz and AA
               to  ZZ.   The  aa queue is the default for aatt and the bb queue for
               bbaattcchh.  Queues with higher letters run with increased niceness.
               The  special queue "=" is reserved for jobs which are currently
               running.

       If a job is submitted to a queue designated with an  uppercase  letter,
       the  job is treated as if it were submitted to batch at the time of the
       job.  Once the time is reached, the batch processing rules with respect
       to  load average apply.  If aattqq is given a specific queue, it will only
       show jobs pending in that queue.

       --mm      Send mail to the user when the job has completed even if  there
               was no output.

       --MM      Never send mail to the user.

       --ff _f_i_l_e Reads the job from _f_i_l_e rather than standard input.

       --tt _t_i_m_e run the job at _t_i_m_e, given in the format [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss]

       --ll      Is an alias for aattqq..

       --rr      Is an alias for aattrrmm..

       --dd      Is an alias for aattrrmm..

       --bb      is an alias for bbaattcchh.

       --vv      Shows the time the job will be executed before reading the job.

       Times displayed will be in the format "Thu Feb 20 14:50:00 1997".

       --cc     cats the jobs listed on the command line to standard output.

BBUUGGSS
       The  correct  operation of bbaattcchh for Linux depends on the presence of a
       _p_r_o_c- type directory mounted on _/_p_r_o_c.

       If the file _/_v_a_r_/_r_u_n_/_u_t_m_p is not available or corrupted, or if the user
       is  not  logged  on  at the time aatt is invoked, the mail is sent to the
       userid found in the environment variable LLOOGGNNAAMMEE.  If that is undefined
       or empty, the current userid is assumed.

       AAtt  and  bbaattcchh as presently implemented are not suitable when users are
       competing for resources.  If this is the case for your site, you  might
       want to consider another batch system, such as nnqqss.
