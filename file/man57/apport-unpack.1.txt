       A problem report, as produced by aappppoorrtt is a single file with a set  of
       key/value  pairs  in the RFC822 syntax. This tool disassembles a report
       such that the value of each entry is written into a separate file, with
       the key as file name. This is particularly useful for large binary data
       like the core dump.

       _r_e_p_o_r_t is either a path to an existing apport crash report, or  '-'  to
       read from stdin.

       The _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y must either be nonexisting or empty.
